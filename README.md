# Titanic Dataset Analysis
*Project Description-*

This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) in a Jupyter notebook. The analysis explores survival rates based on various features such as sex, passenger class, and age groups. Key data cleaning steps like handling missing values and removing duplicates are performed before diving into survival statistics and visualizations.â€‹


*Files-*

- Titanic-Dataset.csv: The dataset containing details of passengers of Titanic ship including survival status and other attributes.
- titanic.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook implementing the analysis, visualization, and data exploration.


*Dataset Details-*

- PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.
- Survived: Survival status (1=Survived, 0=Not Survived).
- Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, 3).
- Name: Name of the passenger.
- Sex: Gender of passenger.
- Age: Age of passenger.
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
- Ticket: Ticket number.
- Fare: Ticket fare.
- Cabin: Cabin number.
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).


*Key Findings-*

- Females and passengers from the first class had significantly higher survival rates.
- Age is a factor in survival, with children more likely to survive, followed by teens, adults, and seniors.
- Data cleaning steps make analysis robust and accurate.
